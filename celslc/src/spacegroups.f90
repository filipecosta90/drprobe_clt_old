!* This module provides space group symmetry data, together with the spacegroup   *
!* number, name and Patterson space group number.                                 *
!* The data was taken from <http://cci.lbl.gov/cctbx/explore_symmetry.html>       *
!* Space group names are taken from <ftp://ftp.iucr.org/pub/cif_sym.dic>          *

!* Depending on the compiler (e.g. IntelFortran) this source file may not be      *
!* compiled with source optimizations. Turn the optimizations off in case of      *
!* strange compiler reports. Optimization failures may occur due to the large     *
!* size of the routine SG_INIT                                                    *
!**********************************************************************************
!* Notes on the model and on how to use it.                                       *
!* The space group data can be accessed from its number 1 ... 230 and from its    *
!* name, which is the Hermann-Mauguin symbol, e.g. P1, F4-3m, I4/mcm, and so on.  *
!* The data is stored in the allocatable arrays:                                  *
!* sg_name, sg_patn, sg_symnum, and sg_symmetry.                                  *
!* We use allocatable arrays here in order to not overload the stack.             *
!* On instantiation, the module data is not allocated by default.                 *
!* Call the routine SG_INIT to allocate and initialize the data arrays.           *
!* The total ammount of allocated heap is about 1.4MB.                            *
!* Calling any of the data access routines (see below) with an uninitialized      *
!* module will cause an auto-initialization.                                      *
!* Call the routine SG_UNINIT to deallocate the data arrays.                      *
!* Call the routine SG_ISREADY to probe the initialization state of the module.   *
!* Data access routines can be used to retrieve the space group data. In order    *
!* to create a fail-safe module, the actual arrays cannot be accessed directly.   *
!* The module should never cause access violations. Each data access routine will *
!* return a success-code, such that the calling routines may identify problems.   *
!* None of the routines writes messages to an I/O unit.                           *
